  Plex Media Server is a software application that allows you to organize and
  stream your collection of movies, TV shows... In short you can have your own
  "Netflix" but better.
---

# Installation

## Requirements

* A server running linux (e.g Debian) w/ Ethernet (min 1Gbits/s recommended)
* [(Optionnal) Smart Plug (If you want to turn on/off your server from anywere + monitor power consumption...)](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
* 2.99€/month to spend for [https://alldebrid.fr/?uid=3dpui\&lang=fr](https://alldebrid.fr/?uid=3dpui\&lang=fr) (this allows you to have unlimited storage so you can have a poor 120GB SSD on for your server + eliminate need of VPN + Instant availability thanks to caching)

## Automatic Installation

{% hint style="success" %}
I made a script that set up a full Plex stack with auto start & updates... Just run this:
{% endhint %}

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kipavy/Wiki/main/.gitbook/assets/plex.sh)
```

## Manual Installation

### Mount your debrid services

We need to setup rclone w/ alldebrid so we can have our files on the server without actually storing them on it. See [https://github.com/itsToggle/plex\_debrid?tab=readme-ov-file#1-open\_file\_folder-mount-your-debrid-services](https://github.com/itsToggle/plex_debrid?tab=readme-ov-file#1-open_file_folder-mount-your-debrid-services)

If you're having issues, here is my personnal rclone mouting command:

```bash
rclone mount my-remote:links /home/rdpclient/plexmediaserver/data/rclone --dir-cache-time 10s --allow-other
```

### Setup Plex Media Server

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to install docker on your server: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)\
You also need to install docker compose if you don't have it, see [docker](../linux/docker/ "mention")
{% endhint %}

Download this file and edit the path to what you want, if you leave it unchanged, it will create a folder /home/plex and will put everything in it. Note that overseerr[^2], tautulli[^3] and flaresolverr[^4] are optional and can be removed from the compose.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/docker-compose.yml" %}

Compose this stack by running this command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You should see something like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Capture d’écran du 2024-03-24 00-20-12.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Open Plex Web UI to start configuration by opening [http://ipaddress:32400/web](http://ipaddress:32400/web) or [localhost:32400/web](https://localhost:32400/web)

{% hint style="danger" %}
You'll need to setup port forwarding on your server to access Plex anywere
{% endhint %}

### Setup

If you want to access your micro-services (overseerr, riven, prowlarr...) with your domain name, read this: [reverse-proxy.md](../self-hosting/reverse-proxy.md "mention")

{% hint style="warning" %}
I don't provide tutorial for setting up jackett with flaresolverr, overseerr and tautulli as it is really simple and optionnal (actually jackett is optionnal but it is very hard to do without it).
{% endhint %}

If you're having issues with rclone container, you can try the following command and restart container:

```bash
fusermount -u /mnt/mountpoint
```
