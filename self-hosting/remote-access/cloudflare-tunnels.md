This has some benefits over tailcale funnels, you can proxy not only on localhost and you can use your own domains.

{% hint style="success" %}
For the installation of cloudflared, if you're using Proxmox, you can just use [https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=cloudflared](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=cloudflared). You'll just need to copy/paste the `cloudflared service install ...` command given during tunnel creation.   &#x20;
